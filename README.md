I am a PhD student in [Anthony Mathelier's Lab](https://mathelierlab.com/) at Center for Molecular Medicine Norway (NCMM), Oslo, Norway. I am studying gene regulation through transcription factor binding and loving it. I am using computational approaches, so I guess you can also call me a bioinformatician. 3000 years ago I was there, in a wetlab too :ring:. I studied Genetics for my bachelor, then Molecular medicine, where I switched to computational data analysis.
